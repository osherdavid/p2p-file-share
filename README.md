# p2p-file-share

A peer-to-peer file sharing application.

## Installation

For comfort and ease of use I higlly reccomend using `just` (A make equivalent for linux and windows alike):

### Windows

```shell
winget install --id casey.just
```

### Linux (Ubuntu)

```bash
sudo apt install just
```

Then you can run:

```bash
just install
```

Or, follow the justfile if you'd like to install manually.

## Run

```python
poetry run p2p-file-share
```

Of course you may also install it directly to your OS, though i would recommend using poetry to save you the hustle of managing versions.
